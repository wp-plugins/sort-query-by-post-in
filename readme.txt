Stable tag: 1.2.3

A very simple plug-in that allows post queries to sort the results by the order specified in the "post__in" parameter.

== Description ==

NOTE: This plug-in has been incorporated into WordPress core as of version 3.5.

Sort Query by Post In is a very light weight (less than 10 lines of code) plug-in intended for developers executing custom post queries. You're welcome to include it in your theme and redistribute - just offer us some credit, please!

When constructing a WordPress post query in your theme template files or plug-in, WordPress offers the option to explicitly specify the posts to retrieve using the `post__in` parameter. Unfortunately, the `orderby` parameter does not offer an option that will sort the result by the exact order passed in the `post__in` parameter. This plug-in adds a `post__in` option for the `orderby` parameter that will order the result by the exact order specified in the `post__in` parameter.

And don't worry about the plug-in being deactivated - your post queries with the new `post__in` value used for `orderby` will simply gracefully fall back to the default date sorting.



== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted
folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Modify the appropriate post queries with the `orderby` parameter set to `post__in`

= Example =

`query_posts( array( 'post__in' => array(20,10,106),  'orderby' => 'post__in' ) );`

That will retrieve posts with IDs 20, 10, and 106 in that order!

== Changelog ==
